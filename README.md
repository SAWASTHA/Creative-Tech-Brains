## Abstract

The development of a mobile application that aims to help patients find the nearest specialized hospital based on their current location. The application also provides information on the availability of various resources such as doctors, medical equipment, bed availability and other healthcare services. The application is designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate, with a simple and intuitive interface. The application utilizes geolocation technology and integrates with various hospital databases to provide up-to-date and accurate information to the user. 
Patient-related data is one of the most overwhelming aspects of healthcare. The storage and retrieval of this patient data, when needed, is a challenge that the hospitals need to address. The proposed application has the potential to improve patient outcomes by enabling them to access specialized care quickly and efficiently.

##  Problem Statement Introduction
 
The healthcare industry is constantly evolving, with new technologies and innovations emerging to improve patient outcomes and enhance the delivery of healthcare services. However, one of the persistent challenges that patients with serious medical conditions face is locating specialized hospitals nearest to their location and determining the availability of various resources in those hospitals.
The lack of access to timely and accurate information about the availability of specialized healthcare services can result in delayed treatment, reduced quality of care, and increased healthcare costs. This challenge is particularly acute for patients who require specialized medical services that are not available in all hospitals.

To address this challenge, a mobile application can be developed to enable patients to locate specialized hospitals nearest to their location and determine the availability of resources in those hospitals. The application is designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate, with a simple and intuitive interface.

## Objective

The objectives of the mobile application for determining a specialized hospital nearest to a patient's location are:

1.	Accurate Location Detection: The application should be able to accurately detect the patient's current location using GPS or other location-based services.

2.	Comprehensive Hospital Database: The application should have a comprehensive database of specialized hospitals in the area, with updated information on hospital names, addresses, contact numbers, specialties, and available services.

3.	Easy-to-Use Interface: The application should have a user-friendly interface that allows patients to easily input their location and preferences, and quickly receive relevant results.

4.	Detailed Hospital Information: The application should provide detailed information about each specialized hospital, including their profile, specialties, services offered, contact information, and reviews from other patients. This information should be presented in a clear and organized manner.

5.	Map Integration: The application should integrate with maps and provide visual representations of the specialized hospitals' locations, allowing patients to see the hospitals on a map and get directions from their current location.

6.	Search Options: The application should allow patients to search based on various criteria such as specialties, services offered, distance, ratings, and reviews.

## Scope And Limitations


The scope of the application includes various features and functionalities such as: 

1.	The application has the capability to accurately detect the user's location using GPS. 

2.	It maintains a comprehensive database of specialized hospitals, including hospital profiles, specialties, services offered, contact information, and other relevant details.

3.	The application allows patients to search based on various criteria such as specialties, services offered, distance, ratings, and reviews.
 
4.	The application integrates with maps to visually display the location of specialized hospitals and provide directions to the selected hospital from the user's location.

5.	The application can allow users to create and edit their profiles. It facilitates communication between users and hospitals, allowing users to directly contact hospitals and schedule appointments.

Limitations: 

The application is limited to patients only but in future we can expand its scope to hospitals as well. The application only provides the location of nearest hospitals.
